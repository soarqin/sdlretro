# sdlretro
This is a lightweight libretro frontend written for SDL, aims to write simple codes that are easy to maintain, and optimize performance on retro devices like GCW-Zero and RG-350.

# Build
* Use CMake 3.0 or later to build the project
* SDL 1.x and FreeType are requrired, and all platforms that supported by SDL 1.x(in window mode or fbdev IPU scaling) and FreeType should be supported as well
* for GCW-Zero/RG350:
  1. create `build` folder and run `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DMODEL=gcw0 ..` in it
  2. run `make` to build the binary
  3. run `./make_opk.sh` in folder `opk` to build Lite Version
  4. or create a folder `cores` in `opk` and put all core files into the folder, then run `FULL=1 ./make_opk.sh` to build Full Version

# Installation for GCW-Zero/RG350
* Full version:
  Just copy sdlretro-full.opk to app folder
* Lite version:
  Copy sdlretro.opk to app folder, create /media/data/local/home/.sdlretro/cores and put core files in the directory.

# Run
* Select game rom to run, if rom file type is supported more than one core, a core selection menu is popup first.
* Rom in zip is supported if there are no more than 2 files (one rom file and one dir/readme) in the zip. If the core does not support in-memory rom load, the rom in zip will be extracted to .sdlretro/tmp and removed on exit.
* Use power-flick to enter menu.
